  "description": "The NOAA 1/4Â° daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (or daily OISST) Climate Data Record (CDR) provides complete ocean temperature fields constructed by combining bias-adjusted observations from different platforms (satellites, ships, buoys) on a regular global grid, with gaps filled in by interpolation. The main input source is satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which provides high temporal-spatial coverage from late 1981-present. This input must be adjusted to the buoys due to erroneous cold SST data following the Mt Pinatubo and El Chichon eruptions. Applications include climate modeling, resource management, ecological studies on annual to daily scales.",

      "description": "NOAAs 1/4-degree Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) (sometimes referred to as Reynolds SST, which however also refers to earlier products at different resolution), currently available as version v02r01, is created by interpolating and extrapolating SST observations from different sources, resulting in a smoothed complete field. The sources of data are satellite (AVHRR) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change over time. At the marginal ice zone, sea ice concentrations are used to generate proxy SSTs.  A preliminary version of this file is produced in near-real time (1-day latency), and then replaced with a final version after 2 weeks. Note that this is the AVHRR-ONLY DOISST, available from Oct 1981, but there is a companion DOISST product that includes microwave satellite data, available from June 2002",
